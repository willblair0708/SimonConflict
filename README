Beh data first published here: 10.1016/j.cortex.2017.02.021.  EEG published here: 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2018.05.020.   PD came in twice separated by a week, either ON or OFF medication.  CTL only came in once.  Task included in Matlab programming language.   Data collected circa 2015 in Cognitive Rhythms and Computation Lab at University of New Mexico.  Subjs also had an acceleromter taped to their most tremor affected hand.  X, Y, Z dimensions recorded throughout.  Check the .xls sheet under code folder for more meta data.   Triggers are complicated.  See CC_Triggers.mat under code folder.  Many analysis scripts are included; no idea how these hold up.   Many are old.  - James F Cavanagh 02/08/2021
